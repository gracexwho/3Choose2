    <string name="final_message">In the end, life is not about trying to do as many things as possible in the shortest period of time. It\'s about finding the right balance. You might only be able to choose 2 out of the 3 staples of college student life, and that\'s fine. Or you may have to do the energy to do all 3, and that\'s fine too. Don\'t let the media or us tell you what to do.</string>
